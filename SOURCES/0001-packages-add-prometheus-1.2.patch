+description: """
+To run services reliably, it is useful if they can report various metrics
+(for example, heap size, queue lengths, number of warnings logged, etc).
+
+A monitoring service can be configured to collect this data regularly.
+The data can be graphed to help understand the performance of the service over time,
+or to help debug problems quickly.
+It can also be used to send alerts if a service is down or behaving poorly.
